# My Portfolio ![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description:

&nbsp; I'm Ariel Schwartz, a Full Stack Developer with a passion for building beautiful and functional web applications. I have B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Arizona (ABET) with a minor in mathematics. I have found demonstrating engineering rigor to be rewarding and aim to challenge myself with a new career and technical industry innovation. With a strong analytical background, 7+ years of industry experience using Mechanical Engineering, a certification in Full Stack including skills in Agile Software Development, I build client-based solutions. I’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of incredible projects that have allowed me to grow and establish myself within this competitive industry. I hope you’ll enjoy viewing some projects on my [portfolio](https://arishorts.github.io/arishorts-portfolio/) as much as I enjoyed working on them.

User Story: AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
