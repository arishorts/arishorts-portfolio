This was a collaborative MVC paradigm project. The Controller is a RESTful API handled with Node.js and Express.js. A View was implemented with Handlebars.js as the templating engine, MySQL with Sequelize ORM for the database Model. Finally, the project was deployed to Heroku to make for a polished, responsive, and interactive user interfaces. Moreover, this app includes features such as session authentication with cookies and authorization, which ensures users can securely log in and manage their polls. An additional goal of this app was to explore ChartJS, a library dedicated to data visualization. Additionally, a presentation was delivered, highlighting the elevator pitch, concept, development process, demo, and directions for future development.`,

One unique feature of this text editor is its ability to be installed as a progressive web app (PWA). This app configures a Webpack development environment for a web application called J.A.T.E. It sets up plugins that generate HTML and a manifest file, add CSS loaders and Babel, and inject a custom service worker to cache assets and pages for offline access.",

          "This Social Network API taught me skills needed for building a robust social network web application. This project utilized MongoDB as a NoSQL database, which is favored in social network platforms for handling large amounts of unstructured data. Express.js is used for routing and implementing a Mongoose ODM to interact with the MongoDB database. The API has several routes for users and thoughts, including ability to create, update, and delete their own thoughts, as well as react to the thoughts of others. Users also are able to create and delete on their own friend lists, and the API will be able to retrieve data for all users and thoughts, as well as for a single user or thought by its ID. This project showcases my ability to format timestamps and handle data validation using Mongoose's schema settings. A comprehensive walkthrough video has been included that showcases functionality of the API. With this project, I demonstrated skills in building a performant and scalable social network API using NoSQL technologies.",

It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to write and publish blog posts on a variety of topics. The app also allows users to engage with each other through comments, making it a platform for building a community around a particular topic or niche.  By building a blog site from scratch and deploying it to Heroku, I demonstrated ability to work with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Utilizing Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication, this ensures that users can securely log in and manage their blogposts and comments. The application follows best practices for file structure, naming conventions, and coding standards, as reflected in the repository's quality.`,
