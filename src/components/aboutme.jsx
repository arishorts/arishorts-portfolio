          I have a passion for building beautiful and functional web
          applications. Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸš€ I have B.S. in mechanical
          engineering from the University of Arizona (ABET) with a minor in
          mathematics. I have found demonstrating engineering rigor to be
          rewarding and aim to challenge myself with a new career and technical
          industry innovation. With a strong analytical background, 7+ years of
          industry experience using Mechanical Engineering, a certification in
          Full Stack including skills in Agile Software Development, I build
          client-based solutions.

          Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on a number of incredible projects
          that have allowed me to grow and establish myself within this
          competitive industry. I hope youâ€™ll enjoy viewing my projects as much
          as I enjoyed working on them. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to
          arieljschwartz@gmail.com if you have any questions.
