        <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
        <p className="pt-3">
          As a recent graduate and long-time admirer of the web development
          field, I am thrilled to pursue open position for a Full Stack
          Developer or related roles. At present I am employed with Raytheon
          Technologies, thus, I feel that my relevant technology industry
          experience would be of great value to any technologically oriented
          company. I am proud of my 3.6 GPA B.S. in Mechanical Engineering as
          well as 7 years of real world experience, and have found this
          rewarding – however, not the correct fit. Having spent countless hours
          tinkering on my own projects and completing a certificate, my aim is
          to continue challenging myself in a professional full stack position.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of web-based
          client-server applications that have allowed me to grow and establish
          within this competitive industry. Within these solo and team projects
          I've deployed intuitive front-end interfaces, with robust back-ends
          utilizing performance optimization strategies. My experience is
          supplemented by modern best practices in Agile/Scrum methodology. I
          believe these skills would be an asset to any company and hope you’ll
          enjoy viewing my projects as much as I enjoyed working on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am enthusiastic of the possibility of discussing how my skills and
          experiences align with your needs and goals.
